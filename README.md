How do I approach designing software?

When designing software, I start by breaking the project into smaller, manageable parts and identifying the core functionality I need to achieve. For this 3D scene, I focused on creating a clear visual concept first—a realistic gym environment—then planned which shapes, textures, and lighting setups would bring it to life. I used modular design principles, separating my code into components such as SceneManager, ShaderManager, and ShapeMeshes, which made the structure easier to manage and expand.

What new design skills has your work on the project helped you to craft?

This project helped me strengthen my ability to design hierarchical 3D structures and apply materials and lighting principles to achieve realism. I also learned to balance performance with visual fidelity and to think about user perspective, scale, and spatial arrangement—all essential for visual design and scene composition.

What design process did you follow for your project work?

I followed an iterative design process. I began by sketching a simple gym layout, then built the scene in stages—floor and lighting first, followed by the rowing machine, and finally walls and props. Each step involved testing, refining, and adjusting transformations, materials, and textures until the environment looked cohesive and believable.

How could tactics from your design approach be applied in future work?

This methodical, iterative approach can be applied to any future development—especially in game design, simulation, or UI/UX work. Building in small, testable sections ensures progress is visible and errors are easier to isolate and fix, improving both workflow and final quality.

How do I approach developing programs?

I approach programming with an emphasis on structure and experimentation. I start with a working framework, confirm functionality early, and build outward with incremental changes. I make frequent use of testing and debugging, especially when working with rendering pipelines or shader code.

What new development strategies did you use while working on your 3D scene?

I implemented transform hierarchies to connect related objects, such as the rowing machine’s seat, rails, and flywheel, allowing them to move and scale together. I also learned to manage shader inputs and uniform variables to control lighting and materials efficiently. These strategies improved my understanding of real-time rendering and scene organization.

How did iteration factor into your development?

Iteration was central to my process. After each milestone, I revisited my code to refine transformations, add new textures, and optimize lighting. Small visual adjustments—like changing light angles or texture scaling—often made large improvements in realism. Each cycle of testing and feedback led to noticeable progress.

How has your approach to developing code evolved throughout the milestones?

Early in the course, I focused mainly on getting objects to appear correctly. By the final project, I was thinking more critically about composition, realism, and efficiency. I became more comfortable debugging OpenGL errors, managing assets, and creating organized, reusable code structures.

How can computer science help me in reaching my goals?

Computer science equips me with the logical and creative skills to design, analyze, and build systems that solve real-world problems. My long-term goals include working in software development or game design, and understanding graphics and visualization expands my ability to create interactive, user-centered experiences.

How do computational graphics and visualizations give you new knowledge and skills that can be applied in your future educational pathway?

This project deepened my understanding of math-based transformations, lighting models, and data visualization, which are useful in advanced computing courses such as game engines, simulations, and AI visualization. It also strengthened my problem-solving and spatial reasoning skills, which I can apply across future studies in computer graphics and software design.

How do computational graphics and visualizations give you new knowledge and skills that can be applied in your future professional pathway?

Professionally, these skills are highly transferable. Understanding how 3D environments are built and optimized can help in careers involving game development, VR/AR applications, digital design, or interactive systems. It also reinforces my ability to think visually and technically, bridging creativity with computation in any software development role.
